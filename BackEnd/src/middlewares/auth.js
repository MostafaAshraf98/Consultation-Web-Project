//important Note: THe idea behind auth middleware is that any request that requires authentication to be executed must have a login token provided
//along with the request to check that the user is logged in
//the token that the user passes is passed in the headers section of the request and not as a parameter or in the body
//Headers allows to set key value pairs providing additional info to the server
//We can have headers sent as part of the request or sent back as part of the response
